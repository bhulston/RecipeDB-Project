## 1. Goal

The motivation behind this project is two-fold:

### Personal Goals:
- **Full-stack Programming Practice**: This project provided a great opportunity to delve into full-stack development, and get hands-on experience working with databases, APIs, front-end, and back-end technologies.
- **Building a NoSQL Database**: The project allowed the exploration and implementation of a NoSQL database (MongoDB) and utilizing it through REST APIs.
- **Development of a Language Model for Custom Data**: Leveraged a large language model to build a "ChatGPT" trained on our MongoDB database that users can interface with

### Project Goals:
- **Implement a Full MERN Stack**: This project is a practical application of the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It allowed the learning and practicing of Javascript, HTML, CSS basics.
- **Practicing Project Management Skills**: The project also offered a chance to develop PM skills such as planning, coordinating and executing a tech project.

## 2. Front end

Intricate UI design with complete user interaction functionality. Some of the key features include:

## 3. Backend

- The backend is a MERN stack which includes MongoDB as the database, Express server to handle API requests, and React for front-end interfacing. 

- It also includes Python-based machine learning models put up as APIs for advanced features.


## 4. Recipe Examples
